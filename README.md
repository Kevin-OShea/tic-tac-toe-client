# Tech used

  Google developer tools, ajax, JavaScript, and jquery calls

# Planning

  Worked on implementing sign in, sign up, sign out, and change password
  functions using forms and authentication api to create and save users, and to
  keep user data secure using tokens. Next,using click events on empty divs to
  hold and place gamePieces. Then created alternating x and o game pieces, then
  made the logic to make sure they dont land on the same spot. Next, updated the
  store.game.cells using the information provided in the game board. Then,
  created the game logic based on the array of held pieces. After implementing
  that, implemented updating the game api board using an ajax call, passing
  in the change in the board. Finally, added hide and show functions on sign in
  out and created the hover effect
